		/*A function is a piece of code that can take an input and perform a specific action. The CSS rgb function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green, and blue, and produces a color:*/
		/*In the additive RGB color model, primary colors are colors that, when combined, create pure white. But for this to happen, each color needs to be at its highest intensity.*/
		/*Secondary colors are the colors you get when you combine primary colors. You might have noticed some secondary colors in the last step as you changed the red, green, and blue values.*/
		/*Now that you're familiar with secondary colors, you'll learn how to create tertiary colors. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.*/
		/*There are three more tertiary colors: chartreuse green (green + yellow), azure (blue + cyan), and rose (red + magenta).*/
		/*A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.*/
		/*Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.*/
		/*You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).*/

	/*The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.*/
