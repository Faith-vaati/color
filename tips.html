		/*A function is a piece of code that can take an input and perform a specific action. The CSS rgb function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green, and blue, and produces a color:*/
		/*In the additive RGB color model, primary colors are colors that, when combined, create pure white. But for this to happen, each color needs to be at its highest intensity.*/
		/*Secondary colors are the colors you get when you combine primary colors. You might have noticed some secondary colors in the last step as you changed the red, green, and blue values.*/
		/*Now that you're familiar with secondary colors, you'll learn how to create tertiary colors. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.*/
		/*There are three more tertiary colors: chartreuse green (green + yellow), azure (blue + cyan), and rose (red + magenta).*/
		/*A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.*/
		/*Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.*/
		/*You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).*/

	/*The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.*/

/*You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color transition, or gradient, on an element.

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.The linear-gradient function is very flexible -- here is the basic syntax you'll use in this tutorial:

linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.

For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:

linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);

If no gradientDirection argument is provided to the linear-gradient function, it arranges colors from top to bottom, or along a 180 degree line, by default.


Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is. For example, a solid wall is opaque, and no light can pass through. But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the glass to the other side.

With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default.

You're already familiar with using the rgb function to set colors. To add an alpha channel to an rgb color, use the rgba function instead.

The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel:

rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue);*/
